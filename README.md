# Todo list

## Description

This is an ordinary todo-list. The first assignment in the javascript basics course was to create a todo list a few months back. Now I want to remake it (in TypeScript) just to see how much I have learned since then. This is a project made just for fun in my free time. :)

### Skills

For this project I use TypeScript and SCSS.
